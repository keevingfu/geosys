# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**leapgeo-sys** is now the **Dymesty AI Glasses Intelligence Center** - a comprehensive content management and monitoring system specifically designed for the Dymesty AI Glasses product. It's a Content Intelligence Center for managing and optimizing the Dymesty AI Glasses brand presence across AI-powered search engines and platforms including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, You.com, and Bing Chat.

The platform focuses on monitoring and optimizing content related to Dymesty's AI glasses features such as real-time translation, privacy protection, AR display capabilities, and developer tools.

## Running the Project

This is a static HTML project with no build process. To run locally:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js http-server
npx http-server -p 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture where each HTML file is a self-contained single-page application:

1. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - `login.html` â†’ `index.html` (main dashboard)
   - Authentication state stored in localStorage (authToken, sessionExpiry)
   - Auto-redirect to login if session expired

2. **Main Navigation Hub** (`index.html`):
   - Collapsible sidebar navigation with categorized modules
   - iframe-based content loading for individual modules
   - Real-time monitoring widgets (AVI, Coverage Rate, Share of Voice)
   - Mobile-responsive design with hamburger menu

3. **Module Naming Convention**:
   - `00x-` - Diagnostic and strategy tools
   - `01x-` - Content creation and management tools
   - `02x-` - Content orchestration
   - `03x-` - Channel configuration
   - `04x-` - User journey tracking
   - `05x-` - Analytics and monitoring dashboards

## Key Technical Patterns

### Chart Implementation
All data visualizations use ECharts v5.4.3:
- Initialize: `echarts.init(document.getElementById('chart-id'))`
- Mock data defined inline as JavaScript objects/arrays
- Common types: line, bar, pie, scatter, heatmap
- Responsive handling: `window.addEventListener('resize', () => myChart.resize())`

### Styling Consistency
The platform uses CSS custom properties for theming:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #667eea;
    --primary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
}
```

### Language and Localization
- **Primary language**: English (MANDATORY)
- **Language Policy**: NO Chinese characters or any non-English text allowed in any files
- **UI Requirements**: All labels, buttons, messages, tooltips, and content must be in English
- **Code Comments**: All code comments must be written in English
- **Key terminology**: 
  - AI Platform Optimization (formerly GEO)
  - AVI (AI Visibility Index) 
  - Share of Voice
  - Content Intelligence Center

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Modules
1. Create new HTML file following naming convention: `XXx-module-name.html`
2. Include standard dependencies:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css">
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@5.4.3/dist/echarts.min.js"></script>
   ```
3. Add navigation entry in `index.html` under appropriate category

### Module Integration with Main Dashboard
To add a module to the navigation:
1. Find the appropriate `.nav-category` in `index.html`
2. Add `.nav-link` with correct `data-page` attribute
3. Module will load in iframe when clicked

## Important Constraints

- **No Build Process**: Direct file editing only
- **No Backend API**: All data is mock/demo data defined inline
- **External Dependencies**: CDN-hosted libraries only (no npm/node_modules)
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support required
- **Language Requirements**: ALL CODE GENERATION MUST USE ENGLISH ONLY. No Chinese characters or text should appear in any page. All UI elements, labels, messages, comments, and content must be in English.

## Dymesty AI Glasses Focus

The entire platform has been transformed to focus on the Dymesty AI Glasses product as a case study. Key changes include:

### Product Context
- **Brand**: Dymesty (formerly Leap Company)
- **Product**: AI Glasses with real-time translation capabilities
- **Features**: AR display, privacy protection, developer SDK, battery optimization
- **Competitors**: Meta Ray-Ban, Google Glass, Vuzix, Apple Vision, Magic Leap

### Channel Adaptations
- Developer Forums (replacing Social Media focus)
- Tech Reviews (specialized for AR/VR products)
- YouTube Demos (product demonstrations)
- Reddit Communities (tech enthusiast discussions)
- GitHub/Documentation (developer resources)

### Content Types
- Technical documentation for developers
- Product feature highlights
- Privacy and security whitepapers
- SDK integration guides
- User testimonials and case studies

All mock data and examples throughout the platform reflect AI glasses use cases and metrics relevant to the AR/VR industry.
